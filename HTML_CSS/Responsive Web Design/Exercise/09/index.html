    <h3>March 1989</h3>
    <p>Tim laid out his vision for what would become the
        web in a document called “Information Management: A
        Proposal”. Believe it or not, Tim’s initial proposal
        was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss at
        the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but
        exciting” on the cover.

            <h3>October of 1990</h3>

    <p>
    Tim had written the three fundamental technologies
    that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which
    you may have seen appear on parts of your web
    browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The
    markup (formatting) language for the web. URI:
    Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address”
    that is unique and used to identify to each resource
    on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. HTTP:
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
    retrieval of linked resources from across the web.

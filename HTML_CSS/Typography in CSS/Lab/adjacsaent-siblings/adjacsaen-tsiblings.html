    This is not red because it appears before any paragraph.
<p>>Here is a paragraph.</p>

Here is some code.This span is red because it appears after the paragraph, even though there are other nodes in between
<p>Whatever it may be, keep smiling.</p>

Dream big
Doesn't matter how many or what kind of nodes are in between, all spans from the same parent after a paragraph are red.

This span is not red because it doesn't share a parent with a paragraph.
